- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkontogiannis

- 🌱 I used to say that I am a Scala/Kotlin/Java/Python enthusiast working on fast-data project and bla bla bla. After some years, I realized that I am none of them. I am just a continuous learner with a strong background in Software and Cloud Engineering. I ‘ve participated in a lot of projects and after 7-8 years I would say that my power is turning chaos into software. It had happened to me 3-4 times to hold a bomb ready to explode and try to disable it. If you ‘ve ever played the game “Keep talking and nobody explodes” then, yes, I am the guy who disables the bomb by collaborating and orchestrating my teams.
